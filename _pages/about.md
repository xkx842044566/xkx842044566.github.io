# 🔥 Welcome!

I am Kexin Xie, currently a fifth-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Statistics at Virginia Tech (VT), under the supervision of Professor [Xinwei Deng](https://xwdeng80.github.io/). My research interests focus on developing data-driven approaches and tools by integrating knowledge from design of experiments, statistical learning, and machine learning/artificial intelligence (ML/AI). By bridging design and modeling perspectives, I address both theoretical challenges and practical applications, collaborating closely with domain experts to tackle real-world problems. My work spans diverse fields, including healthcare, biostatistics, economics, and engineering systems.

**Kexin is on the academic job market for the 2025–2026 cycle!**{: .text-accent}

Specifically, my research covers the following topics:

- Bi-level variable selection for high-dimensional data modeling.
- Experimental design for systems with treatment cardinality constraint.
- Uncertainty quantification with additive Gaussian Process.
- Health and economic modeling for infectious disease interventions.
